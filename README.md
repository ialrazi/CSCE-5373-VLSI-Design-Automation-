Sequence pair is used for non-slicing floorplan representation and the simulated annealing process is applied for area optimization. Implemented the algorithms in C++ and demonstrated with PyQt GUI.

Please run the Simulated_annealing.bat script to get started. A GUI will appear and follow the GUI prompts to get simulated annealing evaluation results for the benchmark floorplans provided in the benchmark folder.

To have a overview of the project, please see the powerpoint slides (Project_Summary.pptx).
